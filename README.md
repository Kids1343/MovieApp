# MovieApp
A sleek application that uses searches and displays information about well-known movies and their relevant details.

### Running the attached code
To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder(MovieApp) via the `cd` command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run `npm install` to install all required dependencies (this will create a `/node_modules` folder).

**Important:** If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use **your backend URLs** or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
